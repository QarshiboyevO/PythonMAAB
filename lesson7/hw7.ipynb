    "## Generalized `Vector` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Create a Python class `Vector` that represents a mathematical vector in an n-dimensional space, capable of handling any number of dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a `Vector` class** that represents a vector in an n-dimensional space.\n",
    "   - The class should support vectors of any number of dimensions, defined by an arbitrary number of components provided during initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The class should provide functionality to:\n",
    "   - Perform vector operations such as addition, subtraction, and dot product.\n",
    "   - Handle scalar multiplication.\n",
    "   - Compute the magnitude (length) of the vector.\n",
    "   - Normalize the vector (return the unit vector).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The class should have methods for:\n",
    "   - Representing the vector as a string for easy display.\n",
    "   - Handling operations between vectors of the same dimension and raising appropriate errors when vectors of different dimensions are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Usage**\n",
    "python\n",
    "# Create vectors\n",
    "v1 = Vector(1, 2, 3)\n",

    "## Employee Records Manager (OOP Version)\n",
    "**Objective**: Create a program to manage employee records using classes and file handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tasks and Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Design**\n",
    "   - Create a class `Employee` to represent individual employees with the following attributes:\n",
    "     - `employee_id`\n",
    "     - `name`\n",
    "     - `position`\n",
    "     - `salary`\n",
    "   - Create a class `EmployeeManager` to handle operations such as adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting employee records. This class will manage the file **\"employees.txt\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **File Handling**\n",
    "   - All employee records should be stored in **\"employees.txt\"**.\n",
    "   - Each operation (add, view, update, delete) should interact with the file to ensure data persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Menu Options**\n",
    "   Implement a menu within the `EmployeeManager` class with the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Add new employee record\n",
    "   2. View all employee records\n",
    "   3. Search for an employee by Employee ID\n",
    "   4. Update an employee's information\n",
    "   5. Delete an employee record\n",
    "   6. Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Functional Requirements**\n",
    "   - **Option 1**: Add a new employee by creating an `Employee` object and appending it to **\"employees.txt\"**.\n",
    "   - **Option 2**: Read all records from **\"employees.txt\"** and display them.\n",
    "   - **Option 3**: Search for an employee by **Employee ID** and display their details.\n",
    "   - **Option 4**: Update an employee's information (name, position, or salary) based on the Employee ID.\n",
    "   - **Option 5**: Delete an employee's record from the file using the Employee ID.\n",
    "   - **Option 6**: Exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Usage**\n",
    "plaintext\n",
    "Welcome to the Employee Records Manager!\n",
    "1. Add new employee record\n",
    "2. View all employee records\n",
    "3. Search for an employee by Employee ID\n",
    "4. Update an employee's information\n",
    "5. Delete an employee record\n",
    "6. Exit\n",

    "\n",
    "Enter your choice: 6\n",
    "Goodbye!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Additional Instructions**\n",
    "1. Use the `Employee` class to encapsulate individual employee data and functionality (e.g., a `__str__` method for displaying employee details).\n",
    "2. Use the `EmployeeManager` class for managing operations such as file handling, record searching, and updates.\n",
    "3. Ensure your code is modular, with methods for each operation (e.g., `add_employee`, `view_all_employees`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Bonus Challenge**\n",
    "1. Add validation to ensure unique Employee IDs.\n",
    "2. Implement error handling for invalid inputs and file operations.\n",
    "3. Allow users to sort employee records (e.g., by salary or name) before displaying them.\n",

    "   - `Status` (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed)\n",
    "2. **View tasks**: Display all tasks with their details.\n",
    "3. **Update a task**: Allow users to modify a task's details using its Task ID.\n",
    "4. **Delete a task**: Remove a task by its Task ID.\n",
    "5. **Filter tasks**: Filter tasks by status (e.g., Pending or Completed).\n",
    "6. **Save and load tasks**: Save tasks to a file and load them from the file on startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Design Requirements:\n",
    "1. **Separation of Concerns**:\n",
    "2. **Support for Multiple Formats**:\n",
