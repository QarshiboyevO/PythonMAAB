    "### Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script called temperature.py that defines two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _convert_cel_to_far()_ which takes one float parameter representing degrees Celsius and returns a float representing the same temperature in degrees Fahrenheit using the following formula:\n",
    "   _F = C \\* 9/5 + 32_\n",
    "2. _convert_far_to_cel()_ which take one float parameter representing degrees Fahrenheit and returns a float representing the same temperature in degrees Celsius using the following formula:\n",
    "   _C = (F - 32) \\* 5/9_\n",
    "\n",
    "The script should first prompt the user to enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and then display the temperature converted to Celsius. Then prompt the user to enter a temperature in degrees Celsius and display the temperature converted to Fahrenheit. All converted temperatures should be rounded to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a sample run of the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter a temperature in degrees F: 72\n",
    "72 degrees F = 22.22 degrees C\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter a temperature in degrees C: 37\n",
    "37 degrees C = 98.60 degrees F\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will write a program called invest.py that tracks the growing amount of an investment over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial deposit, called the principal amount, is made. Each year, the amount increases by a fixed percentage, called the annual rate of return.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a principal amount of \\$100 with an annual rate of return of 5% increases the first year by \\$5. The second year, the increase is 5% of the new amount \\$105, which is \\$5.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function called invest with three parameters: the principal amount, the annual rate of return, and the number of years to calculate. The function signature might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "def invest(amount, rate, years):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then prints out the amount of the investment, rounded to 2 decimal places, at the end of each year for the specified number of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, calling _invest(100, .05, 4)_ should print the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "year 1: $105.00\n",
    "year 2: $110.25\n",
    "year 3: $115.76\n",
    "year 4: $121.55\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish the program, prompt the user to enter an initial amount, an annual percentage rate, and a number of years. Then call invest() to display the calculations for the values entered by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3\n",
    "\n",
    "A factor of a positive integer n is any positive integer less than or equal to n that divides n with no remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 3 is a factor of 12 because 12 divided by 3 is 4, with no remainder. However, 5 is not a factor of 12 because 5 goes into 12 twice with a remainder of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script factors.py that asks the user to input a positive integer and then prints out the factors of that number. Here’s a sample run of the program with output:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter a positive integer: 12\n",
    "1 is a factor of 12\n",
    "2 is a factor of 12\n",
    "3 is a factor of 12\n",
    "4 is a factor of 12\n",
    "6 is a factor of 12\n",

    "_enrollment_stats()_ should return two lists: the first containing all of the student enrollment values and the second containing all of the tuition fees.\n",
