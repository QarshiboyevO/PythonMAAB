#
# 1. Why do you think companies analyze large volumes of data?
#
# Companies analyze large volumes of data to understand their performance and make better decisions. By analyzing data, companies can identify trends, customer behavior, weaknesses, and opportunities. This helps them reduce costs, increase profits, improve customer satisfaction, and stay competitive in the market. Data analysis also supports forecasting and strategic planning.
#
#
#
# 2. If analyzing and sorting large data manually in Excel is difficult, how do you think Python can help solve this problem?
#
# Python can handle large datasets much faster and more efficiently than manual Excel work. Using libraries like Pandas, Python can automatically clean, sort, filter, and analyze thousands or millions of rows of data with a few lines of code. This reduces human errors, saves time, and allows repeated analysis without starting from scratch.
#
#
#
# 3. Imagine you work at a sales company that receives data about 10,000 customer transactions daily. How would you analyze this data?
#
# I would first store the data in a database or structured files. Then, using Python, I would clean the data by removing duplicates and fixing missing values. After that, I would analyze daily sales, total revenue, popular products, and customer behavior. Finally, I would create visual reports and dashboards to present insights to management.
#
#
#
# 4. In your opinion, what tasks can Python be useful for in BI processes?
#
# Python is useful in many BI tasks such as:
# 	•	Data collection from databases and files
# 	•	Data cleaning and preprocessing
# 	•	Data analysis and aggregation
# 	•	Creating charts and visualizations
# 	•	Automating reports and dashboards
# 	•	Supporting decision-making with insights
#
# Python improves speed, accuracy, and efficiency in BI workflows.
#
#
#
# 5. If you wanted to compare a company’s profit year by year, how could this be done using Python?
#
# Using Python, I would load the company’s profit data into a Pandas DataFrame, group the data by year, and calculate yearly profit totals. Then, I could create line or bar charts to visualize changes in profit over time. This makes it easy to identify growth, decline, or patterns across different years.
#
#
#
# 6. If you don’t know Python, what difficulties might you face when working with large datasets?
#
# Without Python, working with large datasets can be slow and difficult. Manual tools like Excel may crash or become inefficient. Repeating analyses is time-consuming, and automation is limited. It also becomes harder to clean data accurately, analyze complex patterns, and produce professional reports, which can reduce productivity and decision quality.
